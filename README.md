[Here](https://medium.com/@gordonnl/wind-waker-graphics-analysis-a0b575a31127#.jhjgvtq6s) is the article about ocean effects.

[Rippling effect](https://my.mixtape.moe/hzvsox.webm) isn't very good probably either I'm missing something or 
my sine functions isn't good.Probably first one as this was the first shader I have ever written.

[Waves](https://my.mixtape.moe/xptzzm.webm) look cool though.
